  can use Google, using a search term like this:<br />
  <div class="code">
    <pre>
[search term here] "» Suggestions »" site:scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/</pre
    >
  </div>
  (“» Suggestions »” matches the “breadcrumb navigation” at the top and bottom
  of the page, to ensure the topic is in Suggestions)
