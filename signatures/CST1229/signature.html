    >A signature is a small piece of text that is attached to your posts. In it,
    you can enter just about anything you like. Perhaps you would like to enter
    your favourite quote or your star sign. It's up to you! In your signature
    you can use BBCode if it is allowed in this particular forum. You can see
    the features that are allowed/enabled listed below whenever you edit your
    signature.</span
