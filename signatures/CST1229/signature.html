  ><br />The
  <a href="https://github.com/LLK/scratch-paint/pull/1698">“Swatches”</a> pull
  request on the scratch-paint GitHub repo, a well-received feature, has been
  locked down, apparently due to the ST not having enough resources to focus on
  that PR. It will eventually come back once they get back to working on it.<br /><img
