The [url=https://github.com/LLK/scratch-paint/pull/1698]“Swatches”[/url] pull request on the scratch-paint GitHub repo, a well-received feature, has been locked down, apparently due to the ST not having enough resources to focus on that PR. It will eventually come back once they get back to working on it.
